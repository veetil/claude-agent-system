# CRITICAL FINDING: Print Mode vs Interactive Mode

## The Issue
- **Print mode (`-p`)**: Creates session files but CANNOT resume them with `-r`
- **Interactive mode** (no `-p`): Supports full session resumption with `-r`

## Evidence
```bash
# Print mode - FAILS
claude -p "My name is Bob" --output-format json
# Returns session_id: abc123
claude -p "What's my name?" -r abc123
# Error: No conversation found with session ID: abc123

# Interactive mode - WORKS
claude "My name is Bob"
# Session saved
claude -r abc123 "What's my name?" 
# Correctly remembers Bob
```

## Implications for Multi-Agent System

### Option 1: Use Interactive Mode
- Remove `-p` flag
- Capture output differently (expect/pty)
- Full session support

### Option 2: Accept Print Mode Limitations
- Use `-p` for simplicity
- Manage context externally
- No built-in session persistence

## Recommendation
For a true multi-agent system with conversation memory, we must use interactive mode, which requires:
1. PTY/terminal emulation for programmatic control
2. More complex output parsing
3. Handling of interactive prompts

The trade-off is between:
- Simple but stateless (print mode)
- Complex but stateful (interactive mode)
