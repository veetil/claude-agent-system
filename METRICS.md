# Claude Multi-Agent System Quality Metrics (DeepSeek SPCT Approach)

## Core Metrics Framework

### 1. System Architecture Quality (S - Structure)
- **Modularity Score** (0-100): Average lines per file (<500), functions per module (<10), lines per function (<50)
- **Coupling Index** (0-1): Degree of interdependence between agents (lower is better)
- **Cohesion Score** (0-1): How well agent responsibilities align with single purpose principle
- **Extensibility Rating** (0-10): Ease of adding new agent types without modifying core

### 2. Performance Metrics (P - Performance)
- **Task Completion Rate**: % of tasks completed successfully
- **Agent Response Time**: P95 latency for agent task execution
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU/Memory usage per agent
- **Concurrent Task Capacity**: Number of simultaneous tasks handled
- **Message Queue Throughput**: Messages/second processed

### 3. Code Quality Metrics (C - Code)
- **Test Coverage**: % of code covered by tests (target: 100%)
- **TDD Compliance**: % of code written test-first
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Average complexity per function (<10)
- **Documentation Coverage**: % of public APIs documented
- **Code Duplication**: % of duplicated code (<3%)

### 4. Task Effectiveness (T - Task)
- **Agent Specialization Index**: How well agents perform their designated roles
- **Communication Efficiency**: Ratio of useful vs total inter-agent messages
- **Memory Utilization**: Effectiveness of shared memory usage
- **Error Recovery Rate**: % of errors successfully recovered
- **Drift Prevention Score**: Ability to maintain focus on objectives

## Evaluation Criteria

### Critical Success Factors (Priority Order)

   - Protocol adherence
   - Error handling in communication

2. **Agent Autonomy & Specialization** (Weight: 20%)
   - Clear role definition
   - Independent decision making
   - Task completion without drift

3. **System Scalability** (Weight: 20%)
   - Linear performance scaling
   - Resource efficiency
   - Distributed deployment capability

4. **Memory & Context Management** (Weight: 15%)
   - Context preservation
   - Relevant memory retrieval
   - Shared knowledge effectiveness

5. **Security & Reliability** (Weight: 10%)
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Data encryption
   - Audit trail completeness

6. **Development Velocity** (Weight: 10%)
   - Time to add new agents
   - Debugging efficiency
   - Configuration simplicity

## Benchmark Dataset

### Test Scenarios
1. **Simple Task Delegation**: Single agent, single task
2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents, independent tasks
3. **Sequential Pipeline**: Multi-stage dependent tasks
4. **Complex Orchestration**: Mixed parallel/sequential with sub-agents
5. **Error Recovery**: Task failures and retry scenarios
6. **Scale Test**: 10+ agents, 100+ concurrent tasks
7. **Memory Stress**: Large context requiring memory management
8. **Security Validation**: Authentication and authorization flows

### Success Criteria
- All test scenarios pass with >95% success rate
- P95 latency <5 seconds for simple tasks
- System handles 100+ concurrent tasks
- Zero security vulnerabilities in audit
- 100% test coverage achieved
- <3% code duplication
- All agents maintain focus (drift score <0.1)

## Risk Assessment Metrics

### Technical Risks
1. **Complexity Creep**: Monolithic components, unclear boundaries
2. **Performance Degradation**: Exponential scaling issues
3. **Memory Leaks**: Unbounded memory growth
4. **Communication Deadlocks**: Circular dependencies
5. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Exposed credentials, injection attacks

### Mitigation Indicators
- Regular architecture reviews (weekly)
- Performance regression tests (per commit)
- Memory profiling (daily)
- Dependency analysis (per release)
- Security scans (continuous)
