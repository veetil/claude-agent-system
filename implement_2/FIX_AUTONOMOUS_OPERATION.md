# Fix: Autonomous Operation for Claude CLI

## Problem
Claude CLI was not creating files when requested by the agent. The agent would receive the prompt but wouldn't execute file creation operations, preventing autonomous operation.

## Root Cause
Claude CLI has built-in security features that require explicit permission before executing potentially dangerous tools like:
- `Write` - Creating/writing files
- `Edit` - Modifying files
- `Bash` - Executing shell commands

By default, Claude CLI will pause and ask for user permission before using these tools, which breaks autonomous operation in multi-agent systems.

## Solution
Added the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to all Claude CLI invocations in the ShellExecutor:

```python
args = [
    "claude", 
    "--dangerously-skip-permissions",  # Enable autonomous operation
    "-p", prompt, 
    "--output-format", output_format
]
```

## Results
✅ Agents can now create files autonomously
✅ No permission prompts interrupt execution
✅ Full autonomous operation enabled
✅ All workspace examples now work correctly

## Test Results
- File creation test: ✅ PASSED
- Workspace integration tests: ✅ PASSED
- Repository analysis demo: ✅ Creates repo-summary.md successfully

## Security Considerations
⚠️ The `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag removes safety checks
- Only use in controlled environments
- Ensure agents operate in isolated workspaces
- Monitor agent activities
- Consider implementing additional security layers

## Example Usage
```python
# Agent can now create files autonomously
response = executor.execute_claude(
    prompt="Create a file called summary.md with the analysis results",
    working_dir=workspace_path
)
# File will be created without permission prompts
```

This fix is critical for multi-agent systems where agents need to:
- Generate reports and summaries
- Create configuration files
- Write analysis results
- Produce output artifacts
