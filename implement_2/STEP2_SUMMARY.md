# Step 2: Workspace Manager - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Workspace Manager that creates and manages isolated environments for Claude agents, supporting file imports, folder mappings, and Git repository cloning.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Modules
- **WorkspaceManager** (`workspace/manager.py`): Main orchestrator for workspace lifecycle
- **FileHandler** (`workspace/file_handler.py`): Secure file and folder operations
- **GitHandler** (`workspace/git_handler.py`): Git repository cloning and management
- **Path Mappings** (`workspace/mappings.py`): Type definitions and path security

### 2. Key Features
- ✅ Isolated workspace creation (temporary or persistent)
- ✅ File mapping with custom destination paths
- ✅ Folder mapping with recursive copying
- ✅ GitHub repository cloning (shallow/deep, branch selection)
- ✅ Path traversal protection
- ✅ Workspace metadata tracking
- ✅ Automatic cleanup for temporary workspaces
- ✅ Export workspace as archive

### 3. Test Coverage
- **48 tests** covering all components
- Unit tests for each module
- Integration tests with real Claude CLI
- Security tests for path validation
- Mock tests for Git operations

### 4. Examples Created
- `workspace_example.py`: Basic file/folder workspace creation
- `workspace_git_example.py`: Repository cloning with local files

## Usage Example

```python
from claude_multi_agent import WorkspaceManager, ShellExecutor

# Create workspace manager
manager = WorkspaceManager()

# Define resources
files = [
    {"name": "config.json", "src_path": "/path/to/config.json", "dest_path": "config"}
]
folders = [
    {"name": "data", "src_path": "/path/to/data", "dest_path": "resources"}
]
repos = [
    {"github": "https://github.com/user/repo", "dest_path": "deps/repo"}
]

# Create workspace
workspace_path = manager.create_workspace(
    "my-agent",
    files=files,
    folders=folders,
    repos=repos
)

# Use with Claude
executor = ShellExecutor()
response = executor.execute_claude(
    prompt="Analyze the workspace contents",
    working_dir=workspace_path
)

# Cleanup
manager.cleanup_workspace("my-agent")
```

## Integration with Shell Executor
The Workspace Manager seamlessly integrates with the Shell Executor from Step 1:
- Each workspace provides an isolated `working_dir` for Claude sessions
- Sessions are tied to workspace directories
- Multiple agents can work in separate workspaces concurrently

## Security Considerations
- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- All destination paths are confined to workspace root
- File operations use safe path resolution
- Git URLs are validated before cloning

## Next Steps
With workspace management complete, Step 3 (Agent Implementation) can now:
- Use workspaces for agent isolation
- Manage agent lifecycle with proper resource allocation
- Support multiple concurrent agents with separate environments
- Enable complex workflows with shared/isolated resources
