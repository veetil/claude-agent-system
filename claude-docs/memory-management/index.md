# Manage Claude's memory

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type | Location | Purpose | Use Case Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Project memory** | `./CLAUDE.md` | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows |
| **User memory** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project-specific preferences | _(Deprecated, see below)_ Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to _/_ and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in _foo/bar/_, and have memories in both _foo/CLAUDE.md_ and _foo/bar/CLAUDE.md_.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Memory best practices

- **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
- **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
- **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
