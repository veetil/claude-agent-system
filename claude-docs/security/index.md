# Manage permissions and security

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type | Example | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only | File reads, LS, Grep | No | N/A |
| Bash Commands | Shell execution | Yes | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files | Yes | Until session end |

## Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

| Tool | Description | Permission Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent** | Runs a sub-agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks | No |
| **Bash** | Executes shell commands in your environment | Yes |
| **Edit** | Makes targeted edits to specific files | Yes |
| **Glob** | Finds files based on pattern matching | No |
| **Grep** | Searches for patterns in file contents | No |
| **LS** | Lists files and directories | No |
| **MultiEdit** | Performs multiple edits on a single file atomically | Yes |
| **NotebookEdit** | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells | Yes |
| **NotebookRead** | Reads and displays Jupyter notebook contents | No |
| **Read** | Reads the contents of files | No |
| **TodoRead** | Reads the current session's task list | No |
| **TodoWrite** | Creates and manages structured task lists | No |
| **WebFetch** | Fetches content from a specified URL | Yes |
| **WebSearch** | Performs web searches with domain filtering | Yes |
| **Write** | Creates or overwrites files | Yes |

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings#permissions).

## Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant's instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

- **Permission system**: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
- **Context-aware analysis**: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
- **Command blocklist**: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like `curl` and `wget`

**Best practices for working with untrusted content**:

1. Review suggested commands before approval
2. Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
3. Verify proposed changes to critical files
4. Report suspicious behavior with `/bug`

While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely
immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working
with any AI tool.

## Configure network access

Claude Code requires access to:

- api.anthropic.com
- statsig.anthropic.com
- sentry.io

Allowlist these URLs when using Claude Code in containerized environments.

## Development container reference implementation

Claude Code provides a development container configuration for teams that need consistent, secure environments. This preconfigured [devcontainer setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) works seamlessly with VS Code's Remote - Containers extension and similar tools.

The container's enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation. We've included a [reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) that you can customize for your needs.

While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is
completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices and
monitor Claude's activities.

### Key features

- **Production-ready Node.js**: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
- **Security by design**: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
- **Developer-friendly tools**: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
- **Seamless VS Code integration**: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
- **Session persistence**: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
- **Works everywhere**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

### Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the [Claude Code reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P â†’ "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

### Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

- [**devcontainer.json**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
- [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile): Defines the container image and installed tools
- [**init-firewall.sh**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh): Establishes network security rules

### Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:

- **Precise access control**: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Anthropic API, etc.)
- **Default-deny policy**: Blocks all other external network access
- **Startup verification**: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
- **Isolation**: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system

### Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:

- Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
- Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
- Adjust network access permissions
- Customize shell configurations and developer tooling
