# Claude Code overview

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands. By integrating directly with your development environment, Claude Code streamlines your workflow without requiring additional servers or complex setup.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Claude Code's key capabilities include:

- Editing files and fixing bugs across your codebase
- Answering questions about your code's architecture and logic
- Executing and fixing tests, linting, and other commands
- Searching through git history, resolving merge conflicts, and creating commits and PRs
- Browsing documentation and resources from the internet using web search
- Works with [Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex AI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex-proxies) for enterprise deployments

## Why Claude Code?

Claude Code operates directly in your terminal, understanding your project context and taking real actions. No need to manually add files to context - Claude will explore your codebase as needed.

### Enterprise integration

Claude Code seamlessly integrates with enterprise AI platforms. You can connect to [Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex AI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex-proxies) for secure, compliant deployments that meet your organization's requirements.

### Security and privacy by design

Your code's security is paramount. Claude Code's architecture ensures:

- **Direct API connection**: Your queries go straight to Anthropic's API without intermediate servers
- **Works where you work**: Operates directly in your terminal
- **Understands context**: Maintains awareness of your entire project structure
- **Takes action**: Performs real operations like editing files and creating commits

## Getting started

To get started with Claude Code, follow our [installation guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started) which covers system requirements, installation steps, and authentication process.

## Quick tour

Here's what you can accomplish with Claude Code:

### From questions to solutions in seconds

```bash
# Ask questions about your codebase
claude
> how does our authentication system work?

# Create a commit with one command
claude commit

# Fix issues across multiple files
claude "fix the type errors in the auth module"
```

### Understand unfamiliar code

```
> what does the payment processing system do?
> find where user permissions are checked
> explain how the caching layer works
```

### Automate Git operations

```
> commit my changes
> create a pr
> which commit added tests for markdown back in December?
> rebase on main and resolve any merge conflicts
```
